##### IT COURSE NOTES  #####

##  Lecture 1.1  ##

# Laptop storage:

# SSD (Solid-state drive):
- All memory, no moving parts.
- Silent, fast access time, less latency.
- 2.5 inch and 1.8 inch form factors.

# SSHD ( Solid-state Hybrid drive):
- Flash memory and hard drive storage.
- SSD caches the hard drive data.

# Replacing laptop storage:

# All internal:
- Open a cover on the back.
- Open the entire laptop

# Can be very modular:
- Two screws and the drive slides out.

# Laptop memory: 
- SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module).
- Micro-DIMM (Micro-Dual In-line Memory Module).
- Memory used in laptops and mobile devices.

# Smart card reader:

# Integrated card reader:
- Built into the laptop.

# External reader:
- USB connected.

# Optical drive:

# Too large for today's portable devices:
- Becoming difficult to find.

# Often removable:
- Replace with other media.

# Read and write CD-RW/CD-ROM and DVD-RW/DVD-ROM:
- In a portable device.

# Video card:

# Often built into the processor:
- Not upgradable.

# Sometimes part of the system board:
- Again, not upgradable.

# Some laptops have upgradable video cards:
- Not the slimline models.

# Screen:

# LCD (Light Crystal Display):
- Light and high-resolution.

# Very, very fragile:
- Get a good case!

# Resolutions are fixed:
- Changes to native resolution may look blurry or not as crisp.

# Laptop power - AC adapters:

# Auto-switching or fixed input:
- Converts AC to DC.
- Input voltage: (110-220)volts.

# DC jack on the laptop:
- Specific to the power supply type.
- Round yellow connector on the back of the laptop.

# Laptop power - batteries:

# Lithium Ion (Li-ion):
- Common in consumer electronics.
- No "memory effect".
- Charging the battery diminishes capacity.

# Different form factor for each laptop.

# Laptop frame:

# Plastic:
- Lightweight, mobile.
- Durable, difficult to break.
- Inexpensive, cost-effective.

# Metal:
- More durable than plastic.
- Can be more difficult to repair.

# Speaker:

# Self-contained:
- Portable audio.

# Not the highest quality:
- very small.

# Often stereo (L/R):
- May include a "subwoofer!".

# System board:

# Proprietary:
- Built to fit.

# Replacement isn't easy:
- Swap the entire board.
- Most components are on the system board.

# CPU:

# Designed for mobility:
- Power management.

# Integrated features:
- Memory controller, Video controller.

# Not very upgradable:
- Replaceable, but not upgradable.

# Often slower than desktops:
- Size and heat are disadvantages.


##  Lecture 1.2  ##


# Laptop displays:

# Liquid Crystal Display (LCD):

# Liquid crystal display:
- Light shines through liquid crystals.

# Advantages:
- Lightweight.
- Relatively low power.
- Relatively inexpensive.

# Distadvantages:
- Black levels are a challenge.
- Requires separate backlight:
- Florescent, LED, etc.
- Difficult to replace.

# Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED):

# Organic light emitting diode:
- Organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current.

# Thinner and lighter:
- Flexible and mobile - no glass needed.

# No backlight:
- the organic compound provides the light.

# Not quite ready for laptops:
- Organic materials degrade over time.
- Decayed images can remain on the screen.
- More costly and power hungry than LCD.

# Wifi antennas:

# Multiple antennas:
- Wifi main and aux.
- Bluetooth.

# Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen:
- It is up high.

# Laptop webcam:

# Video capture:
- Built-in camera and microphone.

# Usually includes both audio and video:
- Specialized drivers and software.

# Microphone:

# Built-in to the laptop:
- Useful for video calls.

# Not good for non casual use:
- Analog or USB microphones can help.

# Fluorescent vs. LEF backlighting:

# LEF-backlit LCD display:
- Backlight is LEDs instead of florescent.
- LEDs around the edge of the screen.
- An array of LEDs behind the screen.
- The latest laptops are LED-backlit.

# CCFL - Cold Cathode Florescent Lamp:
- Higher voltage and power needed.
- Added thickness to the display.
- No longer a common backlight.
- Older laptops will use these.

# Backlight and inverter:

# LCD displays need a backlight:
- Florescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your eyes.

# Some laptops have inverters:
- Convert DC into AC.

# Verify backlight:
- Look closely.
- Use a flashlight.

# May need to replace the LCD inverter or display:
- Choose carefully.

# Digitizer:

# Use a pen-like device as input:
- Stylus input.
- Useful for graphical input.

# Becoming more common on laptops/tablets:
- Or hybrid devices.

# Touchscreen:

# Merge laptop and tablet input:
- No keyboard required.
- But often still available.

# Many options for input:
- Use the best one for the job.


##  Lecture 1.3  ##
