| ##### IT COURSE NOTES  #######  Lecture 1.1  ### Laptop |
|  storage:# SSD (Solid-state drive):- All memory, no mov |
| ing parts.- Silent, fast access time, less latency.- 2. |
| 5 inch and 1.8 inch form factors.# SSHD ( Solid-state H |
| ybrid drive):- Flash memory and hard drive storage.- SS |
| D caches the hard drive data.# Replacing laptop storage |
| :# All internal:- Open a cover on the back.- Open the e |
| ntire laptop# Can be very modular:- Two screws and the  |
| drive slides out.# Laptop memory: - SO-DIMM (Small Outl |
| ine Dual In-line Memory Module).- Micro-DIMM (Micro-Dua |
| l In-line Memory Module).- Memory used in laptops and m |
| obile devices.# Smart card reader:# Integrated card rea |
| der:- Built into the laptop.# External reader:- USB con |
| nected.# Optical drive:# Too large for today's portable |
|  devices:- Becoming difficult to find.# Often removable |
| :- Replace with other media.# Read and write CD-RW/CD-R |
| OM and DVD-RW/DVD-ROM:- In a portable device.# Video ca |
| rd:# Often built into the processor:- Not upgradable.#  |
| Sometimes part of the system board:- Again, not upgrada |
| ble.# Some laptops have upgradable video cards:- Not th |
| e slimline models.# Screen:# LCD (Light Crystal Display |
| ):- Light and high-resolution.# Very, very fragile:- Ge |
| t a good case!# Resolutions are fixed:- Changes to nati |
| ve resolution may look blurry or not as crisp.# Laptop  |
| power - AC adapters:# Auto-switching or fixed input:- C |
| onverts AC to DC.- Input voltage: (110-220)volts.# DC j |
| ack on the laptop:- Specific to the power supply type.- |
|  Round yellow connector on the back of the laptop.# Lap |
| top power - batteries:# Lithium Ion (Li-ion):- Common i |
| n consumer electronics.- No "memory effect".- Charging  |
| the battery diminishes capacity.# Different form factor |
|  for each laptop.# Laptop frame:# Plastic:- Lightweight |
| , mobile.- Durable, difficult to break.- Inexpensive, c |
| ost-effective.# Metal:- More durable than plastic.- Can |
|  be more difficult to repair.# Speaker:# Self-contained |
| :- Portable audio.# Not the highest quality:- very smal |
| l.# Often stereo (L/R):- May include a "subwoofer!".# S |
| ystem board:# Proprietary:- Built to fit.# Replacement  |
| isn't easy:- Swap the entire board.- Most components ar |
| e on the system board.# CPU:# Designed for mobility:- P |
| ower management.# Integrated features:- Memory controll |
| er, Video controller.# Not very upgradable:- Replaceabl |
| e, but not upgradable.# Often slower than desktops:- Si |
| ze and heat are disadvantages.##  Lecture 1.2  ### Lapt |
| op displays:# Liquid Crystal Display (LCD):# Liquid cry |
| stal display:- Light shines through liquid crystals.# A |
| dvantages:- Lightweight.- Relatively low power.- Relati |
| vely inexpensive.# Distadvantages:- Black levels are a  |
| challenge.- Requires separate backlight:- Florescent, L |
| ED, etc.- Difficult to replace.# Organic Light Emitting |
|  Diode (OLED):# Organic light emitting diode:- Organic  |
| compound emits light when receiving an electric current |
| .# Thinner and lighter:- Flexible and mobile - no glass |
|  needed.# No backlight:- the organic compound provides  |
| the light.# Not quite ready for laptops:- Organic mater |
| ials degrade over time.- Decayed images can remain on t |
| he screen.- More costly and power hungry than LCD.# Wif |
| i antennas:# Multiple antennas:- Wifi main and aux.- Bl |
| uetooth.# Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen:- |
|  It is up high.# Laptop webcam:# Video capture:- Built- |
| in camera and microphone.# Usually includes both audio  |
| and video:- Specialized drivers and software.# Micropho |
| ne:# Built-in to the laptop:- Useful for video calls.#  |
| Not good for non casual use:- Analog or USB microphones |
|  can help.# Fluorescent vs. LEF backlighting:# LEF-back |
| lit LCD display:- Backlight is LEDs instead of floresce |
| nt.- LEDs around the edge of the screen.- An array of L |
| EDs behind the screen.- The latest laptops are LED-back |
| lit.# CCFL - Cold Cathode Florescent Lamp:- Higher volt |
| age and power needed.- Added thickness to the display.- |
|  No longer a common backlight.- Older laptops will use  |
| these.# Backlight and inverter:# LCD displays need a ba |
| cklight:- Florescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your ey |
| es.# Some laptops have inverters:- Convert DC into AC.# |
|  Verify backlight:- Look closely.- Use a flashlight.# M |
| ay need to replace the LCD inverter or display:- Choose |
|  carefully.# Digitizer:# Use a pen-like device as input |
| :- Stylus input.- Useful for graphical input.# Becoming |
|  more common on laptops/tablets:- Or hybrid devices.# T |
| ouchscreen:# Merge laptop and tablet input:- No keyboar |
| d required.- But often still available.# Many options f |
| or input:- Use the best one for the job.##  Lecture 1.3 |
|   ### Laptop features:# Dual displays:# Toggle Fn (Func |
| tion) keys:- Secondary functions.- Toggle between LCD/e |
| xternal monitor/both.# LCD switch:- The "refrigerator d |
| oor" effect.- Physical switch on older systems.- Intern |
| al magnetic switch on newer portable systems.- Set func |
| tionality in the BIOS or utility.# Wireless control:# C |
| ontrol your wireless signal:- Airplane mode, secure are |
| as.- Look for a status light.# Physical switch# Functio |
| n key# May include 802.11, Bluetooth, and cellular:- Lo |
| ok for the symbol or status light.# Volume settings:# A |
| nother function key:- May be standalone key.- Often inc |
| ludes a mute option.# Physical dial or button:- May see |
|  visual feedback.# Screen brightness:# Control the back |
| light:- Secondary function keys.# More light, more powe |
| r:- conserve your battery.# Keyboard backlight:# An opt |
| ion on many laptops:- See in the dark.# Secondary funct |
| ion control:- Intensity.- Duration.- Disable.# Touch pa |
| d:# Enable and disable:- Avoid inadvertent mouse clicks |
|  and movements.# Screen orientation:# Rotate the screen |
| :- Useful on rotating tablet/ laptops.- Landscape to po |
| rtrait.# Fn key or hotkey:- Different across manufactur |
| ers.# Media options:# Control audio and video from your |
|  keyboard:- No mouse clicking.# Play, stop, rewind, fas |
| t forward:- Mute, volume.# GPS:# Listen for GPS singals |
| :- Disable the radio.# May also be associated with airp |
| lane mode or other wireless settings# Docking stations: |
| # Docking station:- Use external keyboard and mouse.- E |
| xtend existing laptop interfaces.- Add additional funct |
| ionality.- Desktop adapter cards.- Avoid cable issues.# |
|  Port replicator:- Similar to a docking station.- Does  |
| not have an expansion card option.# Physical laptop loc |
| ks:# Keep your laptop form walking away:- The bad guys  |
| are good at this.# Laptops include metal-reinforced loc |
| king slots:- Connect to the lock.# Connect to a solid o |
| bject:- Nothing moves.# Rotating/removable screens:# Co |
| mbine a laptop keyboatd with a tablet screen# Presentat |
