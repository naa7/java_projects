Michael Mandel, an associate professor in the Computer Information Science Department, has just
secured a five-year grant worth more than $500,000 from the National Science Foundation to analyze
audio recordings from the Alaskan wilderness. This analysis will allow researchers to study the migration
patterns of animals like songbirds, waterfowl, and caribou and assess how they are affected by climate
change and noises generated by human activity.
